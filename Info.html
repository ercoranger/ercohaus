          My design approach is listening to a matter by hand-on experiments and shaping it in the most 'natural' way. Within my practices, I attempt to create the beauty of balancing between control of design and

          He is a designer of a wide imagination and a strongly creative mind.
          Still, his fantasy isn’t stuck in a non-concrete world of ideas, he
          really gets his hands dirty experimenting with alternative building materials.
          Erco Lai’s ultimate goal is exactly to bring innovation in the manufacturing industry,
          promoting the abandonment of unsustainable mechanisms. Erco Lai’s guide has always been
          the Earth itself, simply learning from nature’s perfect processes.
          <br><br>
          Meanwhile, he is an experienced industrial designer and has worked with
          various materials and techniques, from 3d printing ceramic to sheet metal folding.
          His design approach is always searching for the meaning of a material and shaping it in the
          most 'natural' way. With these practices, he notices the beauty of balancing between control
          of design and spontaneity of materials. Also, he learned how vital it is to listen to materials
          and place them into appropriate contexts.

          Erco Lai learned from his own cultural background and uses the five elements theory as the framework and guideline to picture how matters flow on Earth. <u>ercoffice</u> believes everything is
          interconnected and works together seamlessly in an intangible system; the system connects and balances among human beings,
          environment and Earth. This became <u>ercoffice</u>'s framework of projects, within the five elements; wood, fire, earth, metal, water.
          In summary, ercoffice wants to work within this framwork and materializes a new perspective on circularity.
          <br><br>
          <u>ercoffice</u> considers itself as a design factory as well. It focuses on digital craft, nature-based technology and circular materials.
          It is, on one hand, searching the balance between the traditional dedicated crafts and the machine mass-production. On the other hand,
          redefining the roles of digital fabrication and digital craftsmanship. The 'factory' focuses on producing objects with alternative
          materials within digital fabrication techniques. <u>ercoffice</u> expects itself to create a place showing the connection among craft, technology and nature.
