      <p class="project-title">Domesticating Limestone</p>
      <p class="project-text"> Calcium carbonate is a common material widely spread on Earth;
        it is dissolved in rivers and lakes; we can find it in skeletons and shells;
        it forms "tufa" and "stalagmites"; it builds up caves and mountains and it is also in our kettles and water pipes.
        It has various applications in our life in agriculture, food industry, glass industry and cement production.
        However, the main resource of limestone nowadays is mostly from quarries, we extract from the land and
        create messy "tailings" in the landscape. What kind of alternatives could we find in our surroundings?<br><br>
        One of the forms of calcium carbonate is "limescale", a matter we produce in our water softening processes yet
        is often overlooked and discarded. In my research, I attempt to reintroduce limescale as a promising material
        to build and live with. I research how to reconfigure limescale and focus on creating "geopolymers", a chemical
        process to bind inorganic materials together. Based on the material research, I speculate what a "neo stone age"
        would look like, and how this harvesting and production method could be integrated into the city, and change both
        our interiors and exteriors. Can we become Earth dwellers in this domesticated landscape?

      <p class="project-title">geopolymer</p>
      <p class="project-text"> Geopolymerization is the process of polymerizing silica and alumina containing minerals using alkali solvents.
        Discovered (or rediscovered) by Joseph Davidovits in France, geopolymer cements are likely similar to materials used in antiquity.
        Although cements are the most common application of geopolymerization, a range of refractory and structural products have been produced.
        The products of geopolymerization are called poly-silicates.

      <p class="project-title">Synthesizing Neostone</p>
      <p class="project-text"> The concrete industry is at the root of several environmental issues.
        Can humans develop new manufacturing methods using 'geopolymerization' with industrial wastes?
        With this project, I am working on both the imagination and realization of alternative building materials,
        using ‘unwanted minerals’ to close material flows within our urban ecosystem.<br><br>
        From geopolymerization, I create 'Neostones' from powder of marble, lime pellets, sand and slag.
        The Neostone raises awareness from the perspective of the material, by learning from the Earth,
        by blurring the boundary between earth-made and human-made, by mimicking geo-processes and translates
        this into new manufacturing mechanisms.

      <p class="project-title">Neo Scholar's stone</p>
      <p class="project-text"> In Asia, there is a culture of harvesting natural-formed stones from lakes or caves and bringing them into gardens.
        In his practice, he uses some real stones as references and turns them into digital models first.
        With the plan exported digitally, he starts to make the sculpture by his own hands. <br><br>
        The collection is attempting to blur the boundary between natural forms and man-made forms.
        Moreover, it shows a possibility of reusing artificial wastes instead of stealing natural resources continuously.
